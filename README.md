In "Revira e Volta", you are a thief breaking into people's houses in Porto Alegre, a city in the southern region of Brazil. Your boss has given you an order to rob a specific item in each home, and you must do so without leaving any trace of your presence!

Use the mouse controls to toss items around while you look for the item. Once you find it, click on it to collect it. Before you can leave the house, though, you have to make sure everything you moved is put back into their place! You don't want to get caught, after all.
